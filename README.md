# Scrim Trimmer

Log and OCR-based video editing tool for EVE Online Alliance Tournament practice sessions. Automatically detects `CD`, `GF`, and `WF` commands typed in the local chat window, then clips each `CD → WF/GF` segment and stitches them into a single highlights reel. Works best if the local log file is available but also has a pure ORC mode.

## Warning
This app was partly vibe coded. While it works well enough, expect bugs. Be careful when using the tool, while I have tested it on my personal machine (Ubuntu) to my own satisfaction, it has not been otherwise tested. If you do encounter an error, please raise an issue on GitHub.


## How it works

1. **Frame extraction** — samples one frame per second from the input video via OpenCV
2. **OCR** — runs pytesseract on the bottom-left chat region of each frame
3. **Chat analysis** — detects new `CD`/`WF`/`GF` occurrences using a monotonic-count strategy (robust to OCR noise and missed frames); only matches keywords that appear *after* the `>` separator to avoid false positives from player names
4. **Pairing** — for each `WF`, finds the most recent preceding `CD` and records the `(CD_time, WF_time)` boundary
5. **Clipping** — ffmpeg stream-copies each segment (no re-encode)
6. **Stitching** — ffmpeg concatenates all clips into `final_output.mp4`

## Installation

### Executable (recommended)

Download the latest executable for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/AckbadP/scrim-trimmer/releases) page. No Python installation required.

You still need to install **ffmpeg** and **tesseract** on your system:

- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg tesseract-ocr`
- **macOS:** `brew install ffmpeg tesseract`
- **Windows:** install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki), both added to PATH

Then just run the executable.

### From source

<details>
<summary>Build/run from source</summary>

System packages (Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr ffmpeg python3-tk
```

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd scrim-trimmer
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then launch the GUI:

```bash
python src/gui.py
```

</details>

## GUI

Drag a `.mp4` or `.mkv` file onto the window (or click Browse), configure options, and click Run.

### Default directories

The **Defaults** section at the top of the window lets you configure four persistent directories:

| Field | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Video directory** | On launch (and whenever this is set via Browse), the most recently modified `.mp4`/`.mkv` in the directory is auto-loaded. |
| **Log directory** | When a video is loaded, the `.txt` file in this directory whose name contains `"Local"` and whose modification time is closest to the video's is auto-selected as the chat log. |
| **Output directory** | Pre-fills the Output dir option each time a video is loaded. |
| **Chapters file dir** | Directory where the YouTube chapter timestamps file is written after a successful run. If left blank, no file is written. |

These settings are saved to `~/.config/eve-trimmer/config.json` and restored on next launch.

### Chat region

When a video is loaded, a thumbnail is shown. **Click and drag on the thumbnail to select the chat window region** — a green dashed rectangle marks the selected area. The region is saved automatically and restored on next launch.

The thumbnail is resizable: drag the window edges to make it larger for more precise selection. The image maintains its original aspect ratio.

### Options — Main tab

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Output dir** | Directory where clips and `final_output.mp4` are written. |
| **Chat log** | One or more EVE chat log `.txt` files (semicolon-separated). When provided, OCR is skipped and the log is used for CD/WF detection instead. |

### Options — Advanced tab

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **t0** | *(auto)* | EVE game time (UTC) at video second 0 — `HH:MM:SS`. Required when using a chat log if it cannot be auto-detected from the video filename. |
| **Threads** | CPU count | Number of parallel threads used for frame extraction and OCR. The hint shows the number of logical cores available on this machine. |
| **RAM cap (GB)** | 10 | Maximum gigabytes of decoded frames held in memory at once. Reduce if the process is killed by the OS. The hint shows total physical RAM available on this machine. |
| **Verbose** | off | Print OCR text and detection info per frame to the console. |
| **Force Python clipper** | off | Use the pure-Python ffmpeg wrapper instead of the native ffmpeg binary for clipping. Slower but useful for debugging. |
| **Show timestamps popup** | on | After a successful run, open a popup window displaying YouTube chapter timestamps (see below). |
| **Close when done** | off | Automatically close the application once processing completes. |
| **Upload to YouTube** | off | Automatically upload `final_output.mp4` to YouTube as an unlisted video once processing finishes (see below). |
| **Video title** | *(blank)* | Title for the uploaded YouTube video. Leave blank to use the video filename. |

### YouTube chapter timestamps

After each successful run, the tool generates a list of YouTube chapter timestamps — one line per clip in `0:00 Match 1` format. If **Show timestamps popup** is enabled, a window opens showing the timestamps with a **Copy to Clipboard** button. If a **Chapters file dir** is configured, the timestamps are also written to a `.txt` file in that directory.

### YouTube upload

When **Upload to YouTube** is enabled, the finished video is automatically uploaded to YouTube as an **unlisted** video after processing completes. The chapter timestamps are included in the video description.

**First-time setup** — the first time you run with upload enabled, a browser window will open asking you to sign in to Google and grant the app permission to upload videos to your YouTube channel. After approving, a token is saved to `~/.config/eve-trimmer/youtube_token.json` and the browser step is not repeated.

Once the upload finishes:
- The YouTube URL is shown in the status bar
- If **Show timestamps popup** is enabled, the URL appears at the top of the timestamps window with an **Open** button

## CLI Usage

```bash
python src/main.py <video.mp4>
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `video` | *(required)* | Path to input `.mp4` or `.mkv` file |
| `--output`/`-o` | `out/` | Output directory for clips and final video |
| `--chat-region X1 Y1 X2 Y2` | `0.0 0.35 0.15 1.0` | Chat window region as fractions of frame dimensions (left, top, right, bottom) |
| `--chat-log` | *(none)* | EVE chat log `.txt` to use instead of OCR (repeatable for multiple files) |
| `--t0` | *(auto)* | EVE game time (UTC) at video second 0 — `HH:MM:SS`; required with `--chat-log` if it cannot be auto-detected |
| `--threads N` | CPU count | Number of parallel OCR worker threads |
| `--ram-cap-gb GB` | `10` | Maximum GB of decoded frames held in memory at once; reduce if the process is killed by the OS |
| `--chapters-dir DIR` | *(output dir)* | Directory to write the YouTube chapter timestamps `.txt` file |
| `--force-python-clipper` | off | Use the Python/OpenCV clipper instead of ffmpeg (slower, re-encodes, strips audio) |
| `--force-ocr` | off | Run the OCR pipeline even when `--chat-log` is provided |
| `--verbose`/`-v` | off | Print OCR text and detection info per frame |

Examples:

```bash
# Save clips to a custom directory
python src/main.py recording.mp4 --output clips/

# Use a chat log file instead of OCR
python src/main.py recording.mp4 --chat-log ~/EVE/logs/Chatlogs/Local_20240101.txt

# Custom chat region (x1 y1 x2 y2 as fractions)
python src/main.py recording.mp4 --chat-region 0.0 0.30 0.20 1.0

# Debug OCR output
python src/main.py recording.mp4 --verbose
```

## Output

```
out/
  clip_001.mp4      # first CD→WF segment
  clip_002.mp4      # second CD→WF segment
  ...
  final_output.mp4  # all clips concatenated
```

Unpaired events (a `CD` with no following `WF`, or a `WF` with no preceding `CD`) are reported as warnings but do not stop processing.

## Tests

```bash
source env/bin/activate
python -m pytest src/tests/ -v
```

Tests cover keyword matching, OCR-noise robustness, monotonic detection, and all pairing edge cases.
